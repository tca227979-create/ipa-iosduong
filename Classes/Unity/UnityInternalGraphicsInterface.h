// handling of unity "backbuffer"
// internally we still pretend that backbuffer has depth, can have MSAA, or extents different from the window/view size
// we had UnityCreateExternal* api before that was slightly too "wordy" to use, and was also using UnityDisplaySurfaceMTL
//   which is wrong, and introduced to big a coupling
// now, we have two things happening (with different velocities), triggering the need to update API
//   even if this is not (might be not) the final form
// first of all we are working on introducing swift trampoline, where we can simplify rendering logic;
//   but also we do not want to drag in the whole UnityDisplaySurfaceMTL (it doesn't make sense nowadays)
// thus we introduce intermediate explicit "swapchain" structure
// this also plays nicely with moving towards having explicit "swapchain" concept internally,
//   where (not matching view) resolution, MSAA, etc will be handled separately from "here is the connection to window to give to compositor"
// hence we introduce the api using new UnityViewSwapchain structure (with minimal connection to view internals)
// alas we are not yet ready to fully switch to have only swapchain in the platform layer (trampoline)
//   thus we still keep the possibility to create "AA backbuffer that will be resolved to swapchain" or even custom resolution (copied to actual drawable)
// another thing to note is that we are still bound to support "old" CADisplayLink, thus we need to be able to delay acquiring drawable
//   so we still need to make sure we have RenderBuffer connecting to a "swapchain" to do the magic when we want to render to it
// and that's why we have such a big api surface instead of simple "here is your swapchain, please render to it"
//   but this will hopefully change soon
// things of note:
//   * note that we always pass "current" pointer (rbBackbuffer param)
//     this api is working similarly to realloc: if you pass null we allocate and create new render buffer, otherwise we update the existing one
//   * due to this, UnitySwapchainDestroyBackbuffer is called only if we really do not need this type of surface anymore
